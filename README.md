<h1> CS1 - Bridge Toll Project </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project was used to test understanding of variables, loops, conditionals, print, and scanning for inputs. As a university in the a city on the border of Mexico, we were tasked with, creating a program that employees would use, that would take the vehicles size(small - XL), type (commercial or passenger), passengers(under and over 18), and weight, and calculate the fee needed to be payed based on this formula. ((all_passengers-under_18) * passenger_fee +((under_18 * passenger_fee)*(25/100)))/car_size_fee_large + Math.pow(weight,(.5))+car_type_fee. All the values that were scanned were also validated
